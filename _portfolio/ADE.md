I worked as junior/senior research fellow at the <a href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs1/ADE/English/indexnew.jsp?pg=homepage.jsp"> Aeronautical Development Establishment </a>, India in the years 2012-2015. Here is a brief description of my research activities and contribution to various projects. Please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vvhno58Qq8"> click here </a> to see the media coverage for one of the projects. </div>


* Developed Linearized Small Perturbation Model for UAVs using Control System Tool Box of MATLAB and Simulink to design the Control Law for Longitudinal, Lateral-Directional and Nose Wheel Steering Dynamics.

* Developed a Graphical User Interface for providing an interactive access to time and frequency domain parameters of Small Perturbation Model UAV.

* Developed offline non-linear six degrees of freedom simulation models and used Monte Carlo Simulation methods to validate the designed control laws for entire flight envelop.

* Performed Center of Gravity (C.G.) sensitivity analysis of UAV to decide forward and aft C.G. limits for optimum stability margins and handling qualities of the aircraft.

* Carried out Integrator Balancing in Pitch and Roll Loop in UAV control law in order to solve the problem of Control Surfaces Demand Divergence.

* Performed post testing data analysis of various real time airfield flight/taxi for analyzing the response of various flight parameters during the exercise.

* Devised an algorithm for computing the cross track error of UAV during taxi with respect to runway centerline by using Inertial Navigation System (INS) velocities, the performance of this algorithm was validated by Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS).

* Performed extensive Hardware-in-Loop-Simulation (HILS) testing of various versions of duplex flight control computer system software for flight/taxi trial clearance to ensure authentic flight software development as per the designed Control Law.

* Carried out Vertical Gyro De-erection and effect of wind gusts studies on UAV dynamics.
