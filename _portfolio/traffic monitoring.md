<div style="text-align: justify"> This project involves automating the process of traffic monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), computer vision and deep learning techniques where traffic of different directions can be monitored simultaneously. The UAV flights are conducted for gathering the traffic video data. Further, we have developed an algorithm for post processing of traffic videos which uses sequence of operations including digital video stabilization, vehicles detection using Faster Region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster-RCNN), multi-object tracking, and computation of different traffic flow parameters. </div> 

This project is funded by [Ohio Department of Transportation](http://www.dot.state.oh.us/pages/home.aspx).
