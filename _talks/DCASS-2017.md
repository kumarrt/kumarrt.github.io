<div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, various flight capabilities of a tilting rotor quadcopter are presented. A tilting rotor quadcopter is  a  structural  advancement  in  conventional  quadcopter  design  and  it provides additional actuated controls by actuation of propeller motors for tilt.It can considerably improve efficiency of the aerial vehicle during flight. A detailed PD controland differential flatness based control strategy is discussed  to  use  the  propeller  tilts  for  position, orientation and  fault  tolerant control. This work incorporates use of propeller rotational and tilt movement for maneuvering the UAV. A comparative study of fault tolerant PD controller w.r.t. differential flatness based flight controller is presented  by  numerical simulations demonstrating  the performance  of  the flight controller for various modes of flight. </div>
