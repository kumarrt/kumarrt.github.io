<div style="text-align: justify"> I hold Masters of Science in Aerospace Engineering with Dynamics and Control specialization from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio USA. Currently, I work as a PhD researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics as part of the [CDS Lab](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/cooperative-distributed-systems-lab.html) at UC. My research focus is on the on development of advanced and fault tolerant flight controllers for multi-rotor UAVs. I also work on a project for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) where multirotor aerial vehicles are utilized for traffic monitoring using computer vision and deep learning techniques. I have work experience in six dof simulations, hardware in loop simulations, flight testing and post flight data analysis.  </div>
