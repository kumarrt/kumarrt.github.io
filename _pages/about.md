<div style="text-align: justify"> I hold Masters of Science in Aerospace Engineering with Dynamics and Control specialization from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio USA. Currently, I work as a PhD researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics as part of the CDS Lab at UC. My research focus is on the on development of advanced and fault tolerant flight controllers for multi-rotor UAVs. I also worked on a funded project for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) where multirotor aerial vehicles are utilized for traffic monitoring using computer vision and deep learning techniques. I have previous work experience in 6DOF and Monte-Carlo simulations, hardware in loop testing, flight testing and post flight data analysis. </div>
