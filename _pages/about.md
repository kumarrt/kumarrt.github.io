<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a PhD researcher in aerospace engineering and I work in the Cooperative Distributed Systems lab at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio USA. My research focuses on development of <strong>advanced flight controllers</strong>
 for multi-rotor UAVs.  I am working on a project funded by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) where multirotor aerial vehicles are utilized for traffic monitoring using <strong>computer vision and deep learning</strong> techniques. I am passionate to work in development of futuristic aerospace technologies. I hold Masters of Science in Aerospace Engineering with Dynamics and Control specialization from the University of Cincinnati. </div>
