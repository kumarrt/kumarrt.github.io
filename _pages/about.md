<div style="text-align: justify"> I hold Masters of Science in Aerospace Engineering with Dynamics and Control specialization from the University of Cincinnati (UC), Ohio USA. Currently, I work as a PhD researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics as part of the Cooperative Distributed Systems (CDS) lab at UC. I have 3 years of job experience in aerospace industry and 8+ years of research experience in the autonomous control system design. I have prior experience in control system design, dynamic modeling, six-DOF, and Monte-Carlo simulations, Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) testing, sensors and actuators, indoor/outdoor robotics experimentation, and data analysis. I have a strong background in linear and non-linear control design methods including PID control, and sliding mode control, backstepping control techniques, and state estimation.

<br />

I have publications in IROS, ACC, DSCC conferences. I am seeking an internship or full-time opportunity in the area of robotics, guidance, navigation and control (GNC), robot control implementation, verification and validation, dynamic modeling and simulation, applications of computer vision, and deep learning.
