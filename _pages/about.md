I am a PhD researcher in aerospace engineering and I work in the cooperative distributed systems lab, University of Cincinnati, Ohio USA. My research focuses on development of advanced flight controllers for multi-rotor UAVs and utilizing the unmanned aerial technologies for traffic monitoring for Ohio department of transportation (ODOT). I am passionate to work in development of futuristic aerospace technologies. The thrust area of my research is flight dynamics and control and I hold masters of science in aerospace engineering from university of Cincinnati-2017.
