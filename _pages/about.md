I am passionate to work in development of futuristic aerospace technologies. The thrust area of my research is flight dynamics and control of unmanned aerial vehicles and I hold masters of science in aerospace engineering from university of Cincinnati. Currently, I am pursuing PhD in aerospace engineering and I work as a graduate researcher in the cooperative distributed systems lab, University of Cincinnati, Ohio USA. My research focuses on development of advanced flight controllers for multi-rotor UAVs and utilizing the unmanned aerial technologies for traffic monitoring for Ohio department of transportation (ODOT). I want to pursue a career in development of autonomous robotics technologies for aerospace applications for betterment of the society.
